# ABSTRACT

This project represents my puttering around with hardware entropy sources and
random number generation in Windows, to help to our project of mind matter interaction.    

Kit for working with TRNGs (True Random Number Generators), creating Z-score tables, acquiring data and LivePlot! 

# Supported Hardware:

1- TrueRNG and TrueRNGPro (https://ubld.it/);  
2- Bitbabbler Black and White (http://www.bitbabbler.org/what.html).     

# Installation  

1- Unzip rngkit.zip anywhere you choose;
2- Hardware Installation:
	2.1- TrueRNG e TrueRNGPro:
	     Choose from the Installation folder the TrueRng folder, the folder for your device (TrueRng3 or TrueRngPro)
	     Within this folder, right-click the TrueRNG.inf or TrueRNGpro.inf file and select Install. Follow the instructions for installation.
	2.2- Bitbabbler:
	     Inside the Setup / BitBabbler folder, run vcredist_x64.exe (source: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679) and follow the installation guidelines.
	     Insert your bitbabbler device into a USB port and open the zadig-2.4.exe file (source: http://zadig.akeo.ie/). Select your device and click "Install WCDI Driver". Wait for the process to finish and close the program.  

# Usage

1- Inside the rngkit folder, double click on the rngkit.exe file;
2- The program has 3 tabs:
- TAB 1: The first tab is for analysis of collected data. Select a previously generated .bin or .csv file. Clicking "Generate" will automatically generate a file with the same name as the one selected, but with extension .xlsx, with the analyzed data.
Another option is to select another location for saving the file under another name.
- TAB 2: The second tab is for data collection.
Select the device to use, or multiple devices. BitBabbler has different capturing options, with option 0 being in RAW, options between 1 and 4 in XOR.
Clicking "Start Capturing" will generate two files, one .bin and one .csv, for each device.
- TAB 3: The third tab is for collecting and presenting a live Zscore x Time chart.
Select the device to use (BitBabbler can be set to 0 (RAW) or 1 (XOR)). Click on "Live Plot", the chart will open and at the same time two files will be generated and saved(.bin and .csv). When you finish capturing it is important to click "Stop". You have the option to save the generated graph before closing it.
